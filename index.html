            Engagement in multi-party meetings is a key indicator of outcome. Poor attendee involvement can hinder
            progress and hurt team cohesion. With a better understanding of what happens in meetings, organizations
            could address potential issues and improve the overall experience. Thanks to the popularity of online
            meeting systems, whose usage has become widespread due to the COVID-19 pandemic, recording meetings is as
            easy as clicking on a button. However, unpacking interactions and surfacing insights remain a challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conversation is inherently a social process. The words exchanged in a discussion are only part of the story.
            Standard audio or video players offer little beyond basic replay controls. The advancement of AI
            technologies, such as Natural Language Processing, can help transcribe and summarize the textual content,
            but they are less effective in recognizing the intricate social undertone embedded in meetings. In
            multi-party discussions, which are common in meetings, the group dynamic may easily change to respond to
            different attendee composition and behaviors. In order to fully understand the engagement in a meeting, it
            is necessary for users to utilize tools that bring their attention to social cues that might be easy to
            miss, such as awkward silence or turn-taking behaviors.

            The words exchanged in a discussion are only part of the story.
        </p>
        <p>
            This motivated us to design Discussion Flows, a multi-level interactive visualization tool, that could help
            analyze engagement in multi-party meetings.
            We followed a user-centered process to gather requirements from target users and inform the design.
            To demonstrate the solution, we created an interactive protype using the open-source <a
                href="https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/icsi/" target="_blank">ICSI’s Meeting Recorder Dialog Act (MRDA)
                Corpus</a>. We are in the process of planning user studies to perform a robust, comprehensive evaluation
            of the system. We hope the feedback would help us refine the design and pave the way for Discussion Flows to
            be used in every meeting room.

        <h3>The Dataset</h3>
        <p>
            We demonstrate our prototype using <a href="https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/icsi/" target="_blank">ICSI’s
                Meeting
                Recorder Dialog Act (MRDA) Corpus</a>. It was collected
            at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley in early
            2000’s. It consists of 75 work meetings on several projects. Most
            run just under an hour and involve at least six speakers. The dataset
            is released with rich annotations, including word-level orthographic
            transcriptions, topic assignments, and detailed speaker information.
        </p>

        <h3>Requirments and Design</h3>
        <p>
            We started with a user-centered design process to ensure
            that our design goals were grounded on realistic use cases.
            We conducted ten semi-structured interviews with participants recruited
            from our industry partner SAP, a large enterprise software
            company. The participants are from a wide range of roles and they
            attend group meetings frequently. Interviews lasted between 15 to
            30 minutes. The participants were asked to discuss around two
            probing questions: (1) what would they want to know if they miss a
            team meeting? (2) what would they want to share about a meeting
            if asked by someone else who has missed it? We learned that:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The inquiry is driven by agenda: participants are interested to
                discussions related to their responsibilities, such as the project
                they work on. However, the definition of relevance is broad.
                Seemingly irrelevant projects might be useful if they share similar
                work items. Their experience with one meeting is often influenced
                by past meetings from the same serial.
            </li>
            <li>
                Context is important when interpreting decisions: participants
                want to know how a decision was reached, such as who proposed
                the solution or how much deliberation happened; then they
                assess the quality of the decision accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Long-term engagement patterns are informative for managing a
                group: participants with managing responsibilities also emphasized
                the importance of being able to understand the participation
                of all group members across multiple meetings.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The interviews helped us identify users with managing roles, e.g.,
            team managers, technical leads, as the target users, because their
            responsibilities require them to pay attention to engagement from
            both a productivity and a team building aspects. Along with the
            need of maintaining the agenda and context, two critical elements
            emerged from the interviews, we defined the following tasks:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                T1: Users should be able to compare and contrast participant
                engagement in multiple meetings based on their desired criteria.
            </li>
            <li>
                T2: Users should be able to analyze meeting structures and
                speaking behavior in detail, such as the turn-take patterns, presentation
                formats, or interruptions.
            </li>
            <li>
                T3: The transition between levels should be logical and intuitive.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Discussion Flows: Overview level</h3>
        <p>
            At the top level, Discussion Flows
            provides an overview of all meetings. Users can choose either a
            week view where meetings are sorted into different columns representing
            days of a week or a time view where meetings
            from the same week are sorted into rows representing time
            slots. Time slots without meetings are minimized to save
            interface estate.
        </p>

        <img class="size_m" src="image/overview_week.png">
        <div class="caption">Overview in week view</div>
        <img class="size_m" src="image/overview_time.png">
        <div class="caption">Overview in time view</div>

        <p>
            We chose a glyph-based approach, which represents
            each meeting as a small independent visual element. A main
            strength of glyphs is that they allow the identification of patterns
            involving several dimensions and they can be placed in different
            layout strategies. Each glyph contains several
            color-coded stacked bars. Each bar represents an item in the meeting
            agenda and they are placed in the same order as they were
            discussed in the meeting from left to right. Each colored segment
            in these stacked bars represent one speaker and the height corresponds
            to the duration of that person’s involvement in the agenda.
        </p>

        <p>
            The colors used in the glyphs denote additional attributes about
            speakers. The left side of the interface provides various filters that
            help analyze meetings based on the speakers’ role, gender, or native
            language. Each category employs a different color theme. When
            selected, all glyphs would be updated to the corresponding colors
            to contrast the differences among options within this category. The
            speaker role is the default color theme. If a single option within a
            category is selected as filter, we highlight the contributions from
            applicable participants by greying out other’s contributions. Users
            can go further to select a single individual to compare this person’s
            contributions in different meetings. In addition, we offer a "Search
            in Topics" feature to help locate all topics containing the keyword.
        </p>

        <h3>Flow Diagrams</h3>
        <p>
            To assist further analysis of
            a particular meeting, Discussion Flows offers three more levels of
            details that can be accessed by selecting the target of interest or
            zooming. They provide more information about a meeting
            by visualizing how participants with different roles and attributes
            behave at different parts of the meeting agenda. We adopted flow
            diagrams to convey a participant’s engagement from one agenda to another.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flow diagrams allow using more visual attributes to convey additional
            engagement information. The current prototype conveys
            interruptions. We designed three types of lines to a flow’s top edge
            to indicate how often a speaker is interrupted over an agenda. We approximate the level of interruption
            based on the
            number of utterances. A solid line means no or little interruptions,
            a dashed line means some interruptions, and a dotted line means
            many interruptions.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also introduced different shades of color in
            this view. The flow diagram inherits the same color theme from the
            overview page so that users can maintain a consistent visual impression
            of the engagement depicted, especially necessary if they
            follow through from filtered results. For multiple participants with
            the same role, we take the role color as the base color and produce
            different shades according to other distinguishing attributes.
            In the current implementation, we use speaker age for this calculation.
        </p>

        <h3>Discussion Flows: Topic levels</h3>
        <p>
            At the topic level, the vertical axis depicts
            the duration of time spent on one agenda and the horizontal
            axis represents the order in which the agendas were discussed. To
            help trace a speaker, the flows of speakers who do not contribute to
            an agenda are still drawn, but passing below the agenda bar. Agenda
            descriptions were printed under the corresponding bars. A small Parallel Coordinate, shown on the
            left side of the flows, is designed to augment participants with additional
            attributes. They also serve as filter controls. Users can select
            an attribute to highlight the corresponding flows.
        </p>
        <img src="image/fd_1.png">
        <div class="caption">A meeting with eight participants; the discussions cover five main topics.</div>
        <img src="image/fd_female.png">
        <div class="caption">Contributions from female speakers are highlighted.</div>
        <p>
            It is common that a top level agenda has multiple sub items. Therefore, we designated level 2 to show only
            top level agenda.
            When users wish to learn more of a discussion, they can zoom in
            to reveal the current agenda’s sub items.
        </p>
        <img src="image/fd_2.png">
        <div class="caption">Each topic is broken down into smaller sub-topics.</div>
        <img src="image/fd_3.png">
        <div class="caption">Sub-topics may evolve into even more detailed topics.</div>

        <h3>Discussion Flows: Word level</h3>
        <p>
            Users can also navigate to the word level, which summarizes
            participant contributions during a customizable time interval
            instead of agendas. With a smaller interval users can observe closeup
            interactions, such as overlapping of agenda sub items. Filter and
            highlight features work the same as previous levels.
